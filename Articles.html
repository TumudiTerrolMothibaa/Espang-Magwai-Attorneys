                3 April 2017 @ 08:00 - The moment etched in our memories as Espag Magwai 
                made history by lodging the first transaction in the Limpopo Deeds Office. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Prior to this date, all conveyancing matters within the Limpopo province 
                were attended to by the Pretoria Deeds Office.  The legal position has 
                now changed, and the Limpopo Deeds Office has exclusive jurisdiction over 
                property matters within the Province. This means faster turn-around times 
                and less costs for local attorneys.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mr Rhemtula from Espag Magwai executed their first deed before the 
                Registrar of Deeds shortly after the opening of the Limpopo Deeds Office.
            </p>
            <p>
                “This is a major milestone for our Province and the legal profession, 
                and we are elated to execute our own documents at the Deeds Office” 
                said Rhemtula in an exclusive interview.
            </p>
            <p>
                Best wishes to William Ngququ (Registrar of Deeds Limpopo) and his team, 
                who worked tirelessly to ensure the successful and smooth transition, 
                opening and operating of the Limpopo Deeds Office despite all the negativity 
                from the pessimists.
            </p>
            <p>
